What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?

Controller containment is utilizing space in a view controller to display information from another view controller separate from the one it is featured in. Sometimes if code is dense and unwieldy, it can help organize information if separate files are used to code out the processes, but then use one space to display them for effectiveness. 

What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?

Navigation controllers assist in redirecting the app's views back to a singular root page that is usually the starting point of an app's display. Tab controllers are a similar concept but allow two or more branches to stem from the original root tab controller. They both will help direct users to get to the right views within your app and navigate back from them.

Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.

iMessage is an example of an app that uses a navigation controller. Different views are available and can be stacked within multiple layers i.e.: list of all messages -> specific message thread -> information about the contact 

Instagram utilizes tab bar controllers to allow the user to access different stacks of their home, search, upload, activity, and profile pages. Each page has a back navigation button that allows you to go back.
